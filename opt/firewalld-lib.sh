# rules of your own go in a zone you made, or in the default zone, which setup_firewall
# (install/system.sh) edits rule by rule and never replaces.
#
# A guest bridge needs its own zone because firewalld otherwise treats it as any other
# interface: the default zone, which drops what a guest sends the host, and no forwarding.
# `trusted` is what upstream docs suggest, and it opens every host port to the guests.
